Forums are a common component of online courses. Generally, they are used a 
medium for students and instructors to interact with one another for discussion,
inquiry, etc.

Instructors generally use these forums to make announcements regarding due dates,
answer student questions and comment on student discussion. This project explored
how faculty engagement in these specific environments affected various student 
outcomes. Specifically, we investigate its relationship with student forum activity
and student grades.

This project had several other collaborators whose work may or may not be included
in this repository. The other collaborators who helped accomplish this project
were Phil Arcuria, Patrick Pettyjohn, and Mike Sharkey.

### Project Highlights

#### Types of Engagement

* Presence of a __Hallway Conversation__

  "Hallway Conversations" are instructor-led general discussion forums that are meant
  to replicate natural conversation that would take a place in a physical classroom
  
* Post Consistency

  How consistently are instructors making posts? We do not make distinction between types of
  posts or in which forums these are taking place - only the variation in posts
  from week to week.

* Post Quantity

  The overall number of posts made by faculty and instructors in the course


#### Tested Outcomes

* Student Perception of Faculty Engagement

  Students are given optional course evaluation surveys at the end of the semester. Three
  of the questions on the survey pertain to how the student percieves the faculty instruction
  of the course. Responses are given on a 5-point Likert scale, ranging from 1 (low) to 5 (high)
  
* Student Posting Activity

  The average number of posts per student in a given course
  
* Student Grades

  The average student grade received in a course-section, converted to a 4.33 numeric scale

#### Results

On the whole, faculty engagement in discussion forums seemed to have no significant impact
on any of the outcomes we examined. These results are somewhat counterintuitive, given that
faculty engagement is widely believed to be a key factor in student success. 

We believe there to be two reasonable explanations for this outcome. First, the scope was rather
narrow in regards to the possible ways faculty can engage with their students. The study was limited
to activity within discussion forums and may have excluded a variety of other methods of communication 
like email, announcements, or in-person discussion. Second, we found evidence to suggest that much of the
activity on the forums came about simply because of unspoken institutional policy. Several instructional
designers confirmed that it is generally suggested to instructors to require students to make three 
posts per week. We found that the majority of the course-sections had roughly 3 posts per student per week
for the duration of the course, suggesting that students might be posting simply in order
to meet a particular arbitrary requirement. Hypothetically, this could keep forums from being a place
for natural discussion and peer-to-peer learning.

#### Conclusion

This project was meant to be a very preliminary exploration into faculty use of forums and their effect
on various student outcomes. From the surface it did not appear that there were any significant relationships
but it could certainly be the case that our operational definitions of engagement were too restrictive,
or that discussion forums simply aren't being used the way we assumed they were. In either case,
there is still much to explore in this domain.
