# Biography

Hi! My name is Will Morgan, and I am currently a research associate for the Action
Lab at EdPlus, an ASU organization. I spend most of my studying inequity
in online higher education and student behavior in online courses. On the side,
I am a consultant for 6-4-3 Charts, an organization that builds spray charts for
NCAA Baseball and Softball teams.

I am primarily interested in how students' decisions and behaviors affect various
learning outcomes, but I have also spent a significant amount of time characterizing
how online courses are designed and implemented by faculty.
